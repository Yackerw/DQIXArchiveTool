Usage: Drag a GP2 file or compressed file onto DQIXDecompress.exe and it will extract the gp2 file's contents into a folder named "export", or create a new decompressed file named the same as the compressed one but with .dcmp at the end.
Drag a folder or un-compressed file onto DQIXCompress.exe and it will create a gp2 archive file based on the folder, or compress the file. Appending .gp2 to the folder name for gp2 archives, or .cmp for compressed files.
